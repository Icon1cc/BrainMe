\section{Data Management}

\subsection{Data Storage}

\subsubsection{Convex Database}

The Convex database is the main storage solution for BrainMe. It stores all structured data related to users, quizzes, messages, and leaderboard information. The database schema is designed to ensure efficient data retrieval and management.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Users Collection:} The users collection stores information about registered users, including their email, username, and profile picture URL. Profile pictures are stored in cloud storage. Other fields include friends list and file storage for user-uploaded files. Sub-collections store references to quizzes and messages the user is involved in.
  \item \textbf{Quizzes Collection:} Quizzes from The Trivia API are stored in the Convex database. This collection includes quiz categories, difficulty levels, individual questions, and answers. Each quiz document links to the relevant user who created or participated in the quiz.
  \item \textbf{Messages Collection:} The messages collection stores all chat messages exchanged within the application. Each message document includes the sender's reference, the content of the message, and a timestamp.
  \item \textbf{Statistics Collection:} The statistics collection stores all information related to user statistics including the number of correct answers, the points the user has earned to date, the user level, and the number of games played.
  \item \textbf{Chat Collection:} The chat collection stores information about each chat, including the participants, the last comment made, and the timestamp of the last activity.
  \item \textbf{Leaderboard Collection:} The leaderboard collection stores information about user rankings and points. This collection includes user IDs, the points each user has earned, and their ranking position.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Cloud Storage}

\subsubsection{Profile Pictures and Attachments}

Cloud storage is used to store user-generated content such as profile pictures and attachments uploaded. The structure of the storage is organized by user IDs to ensure easy retrieval and management.

\subsubsection{Storage Structure}

The main folders in cloud storage include:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Profile Pictures:} Each user has a unique profile picture stored in this folder.
\item \textbf{Avatars:} Predefined avatars are stored in separate folders.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Shared Preferences}

\subsubsection{Local Storage for Preferences}

Shared preferences provide persistent storage for simple data in a key-value format on the device's memory. This is used to store user preferences such as:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Notification Settings:} Users can enable or disable chat notifications (keys: notificationChat).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{External Services}

\subsubsection{Clerk Authentication}

Clerk manages user authentication, supporting email/password logins and Single Sign-On (SSO) with Google, Facebook and Apple. It stores user credentials and ensures secure access to the application.

\subsubsection{The Trivia API}

The Trivia API provides a vast collection of quiz questions. These questions are categorized by genre and difficulty level, and are stored in the Convex database for use in the quiz-based learning feature.

\subsection{Local Storage}

\subsubsection{File Upload and Download}

One of the key features of BrainMe is the ability to upload and view attachments. Users can upload various file types (e.g., PDFs, images) from their device's local storage. Public notes and attachments can be downloaded by other registered users for offline access.

\subsection{Components Architecture}

The architecture of the app is designed to work seamlessly on both tablets and iOS mobile screens. We use responsive design principles to ensure a consistent user experience across different devices. The layout adapts to various screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing and interaction experience.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Presentation Layer:} This layer is where users interact with the app. It includes:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{RegistrationScreen}: Where users sign up.
        \item \textit{LoginScreen}: Where users log in.
        \item \textit{ProfileScreen}: Where users view and edit their profile.
        \item \textit{QuizInterface}: Where users take quizzes.
        \item \textit{QuizSelectionScreen}: Where users select quiz topics.
        \item \textit{LeaderboardScreen}: Where users see rankings.
        \item \textit{MessagingInterface}: Where users send and receive messages.
    \end{itemize}

         \item \textbf{Business Logic Layer:} This layer handles the main functions and rules of the app. It includes:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textit{UserModel}: Manages user data.
            \item \textit{StatisticsModel}: Tracks user statistics.
            \item \textit{QuizModel}: Manages quiz data.
            \item \textit{LeaderboardModel}: Manages leaderboard data.
            \item \textit{ChatModel}: Manages chat data.
            \item \textit{MessageModel}: Manages messages.
        \end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.1\linewidth, height=0.4\textheight]{Images/Components Architecture.png}
    \caption{Layered Architecture}
\end{figure}


    \item \textbf{Data Layer:} This layer handles storing and retrieving data. It includes:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{ClerkAuthentication}: Manages user logins.
        \item \textit{InternalStorage}: Stores data on the device.
        \item \textit{TriviaAPI}: Provides quiz questions.
        \item \textit{ConvexDatabase}: Stores structured data.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The layers are linked like this: 

\begin{itemize}
     
    \item The \textbf{Presentation Layer} shows data to users and gets their inputs.
    \item The \textbf{Business Logic Layer} processes this data and applies the appâ€™s rules.
    \item The \textbf{Data Layer} stores and retrieves the data when needed.
\end{itemize}

For example, when a user logs in (Presentation Layer), the login details are sent to the \textit{UserModel} (Business Logic Layer), which checks the details with \textit{ClerkAuthentication} (Data Layer). If the login is successful, the user's profile data is retrieved from the \textit{ConvexDatabase} (Data Layer) and displayed on the \textit{ProfileScreen} (Presentation Layer). \\\\
This setup makes it easy to manage and update the app. Each layer does its specific job, making the app work smoothly.

\subsection{Class Diagrams}

Class diagrams played a crucial part of the design and architecture of our BrainMe mobile application. They visually represent the structure of the system by showing the system's classes, their attributes, and the relationships among objects. This helped us in understanding how data is managed within the application, ensuring that the data remains organized and non-redundant.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth, height=0.4\textheight]{Images/class diagram.png}
    \caption{Class Diagram}
\end{figure}

The above class diagram illustrates the main components of the BrainMe application:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{User:} Represents a user in the system. Each user has attributes like `tokenIdentifier`, `username`, a list of friends (`friends`), and an optional `file`.
    
    \item \textbf{Chats:} Represents a chat session between two users. It includes the `user\_1` and `user\_2` involved in the chat, the timestamp of the chat, and an optional `last\_comment`.
    
    \item \textbf{Messages:} Represents the individual messages within a chat. It contains the `chat\_id` it belongs to, the `user` who sent it, the `content` of the message, and an optional `file`.
    
    \item \textbf{Leaderboard:} Represents the leaderboard data. It includes `user\_id` and `points`.
    
    \item \textbf{Quiz:} Represents the quiz data associated with a user. It includes `user\_id`, `category`, `difficulty`, a list of `questions`, a list of `answers` (which includes `incorrectAnswers` and `correctAnswer`), and a list of `userAnswers`.
    
    \item \textbf{UserStatistics:} Represents the statistics for a user. It includes `user\_id`, `games`, `points`, `level`, and `correctAnswers`.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{The relationships between these classes are as follows:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item A \textbf{User} can have multiple \textbf{Chats} and can send multiple \textbf{Messages}.
    \item Each \textbf{Chat} contains multiple \textbf{Messages}.
    \item A \textbf{User} is ranked in the \textbf{Leaderboard}.
    \item A \textbf{User} can participate in multiple \textbf{Quizzes}.
    \item A \textbf{Quiz} contains multiple \textbf{Answers}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Importance and Benefits:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data Organization:} The class diagram ensures that the data is structured logically, making it easier to manage and retrieve information.
    \item \textbf{Non-redundant Data:} By clearly defining the relationships and dependencies, the diagram helps in avoiding data redundancy.
    \item \textbf{Clear Understanding:} It provides a clear visual representation of the system's structure, aiding developers and stakeholders in sunderstanding the system's functionality.
    \item \textbf{Efficient Development:} With a well-defined class diagram, we were able to follow a structured approach to build and expand the application.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sequence Diagrams}

Sequence diagrams offer a visual representation of how different components or objects interact and cooperate within our system; these diagrams provide a clear understanding of the system's behavior, communication patterns, and the responsibilities of each element. For these reasons, the sequence diagram of the most relevant actions of our application is shown.

\subsection{Gamification}

Gamification plays a significant role in enhancing user engagement and motivation in the BrainMe application. Here is how it is implemented:

\textbf{Points System:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Completing an easy quiz earns the user 2 points.
    \item Completing a medium quiz earns the user 3 points.
    \item Completing a hard quiz earns the user 5 points.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{General Formula: }

\begin{itemize}
    \item For any \textbf{level $n$}: \\
    $L_n = 10 \times 2^{(n-1)}$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Level Progression:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Level 1:} \\
    $L_1 = 0$
    \item \textbf{Level 1 to Level 2:} \\
    $L_{1\rightarrow2} = 10 \times 2^1 = 10$
    \item \textbf{Level 2 to Level 3:} \\
    $L_{2\rightarrow3} = 10 \times 2^2 = 20$
    \item \textbf{Level 3 to Level 4:} \\
    $L_{3\rightarrow4} = 10 \times 2^3 = 40$
    \item \textbf{Level 4 to Level 5:} \\
    $L_{4\rightarrow5} = 10 \times 2^4 = 80$
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Medals and Rewards:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Users who achieve the top 3 ranks on the leaderboard receive special Medals.
    \item These Medals are displayed on their profiles to acknowledge their achievements and motivate other users.
\end{itemize}

This gamification strategy not only encourages users to actively participate in quizzes and improve their knowledge but also fosters a sense of achievement and competition among users.
